# Security Policy for Timer System Web App

_Last Updated: March 18, 2025_

At **BluePrime**, we are committed to maintaining the highest standards of security for our Timer System Web App. Our web application is designed to help users manage their time effectively, and its reliability is paramount. In addition, the Timer Keeper Active extension works hand in hand with the web app to ensure uninterrupted timing even in challenging browser conditions. This document details our security practices, guidelines for reporting vulnerabilities, and the processes we have in place to safeguard our users and our system.

## 1. Security Practices

- **Data Protection:**  
  Our Timer System Web App is engineered to handle minimal user data. We do not collect personal or sensitive information beyond what is necessary for timer functionality and user preferences. All data is processed securely and stored using best practices to prevent unauthorized access.

- **Robust Architecture:**  
  The web app is built with a focus on resilience against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL injection). We adhere to secure coding standards and continuously update our technology stack to mitigate emerging threats.

- **Complementary Extension Security:**  
  Although managed separately, the Timer Keeper Active extension integrates with the web app to enhance timer performance. Both components are designed to follow the principle of least privilege, ensuring that only essential permissions are requested and that all interactions between the web app and the extension are secured.

- **Regular Audits and Updates:**  
  Our codebase undergoes regular security audits and community reviews. We proactively address vulnerabilities and issue timely updates to ensure the ongoing security of the Timer System Web App.

- **Manifest v3 and Modern Standards:**  
  For the Timer Keeper Active extension, we use Manifest v3, which enforces stricter security policies. This further reinforces the overall security ecosystem supporting our web app.

| Web Vulnerabilities             | We perform regular code audits, use secure coding practices, and leverage modern frameworks that mitigate common web threats.  |
| Extension Integration Risks     | The Timer Keeper Active extension operates on a least-privilege basis and is separately audited to ensure it does not introduce additional risk to the web app. |
| Data Leakage                    | The system is designed not to collect or store unnecessary data, minimizing the risk of leakage.          |
