## 📐 Architecture

Chrona backend is designed for **resilience**, **security**, and **modularity**. Using a **microservice-inspired architecture**, the core Django API is augmented with a logging service (FastAPI), Redis-powered real-time streams, and task workers that offload time-sensitive operations.

### 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Session Persistence**: Countdown states are preserved across sessions and devices.
- **Observable-by-Design**: Every user interaction (start, pause, resume) is logged and monitored via distributed tracing and real-time dashboards.
- **Decoupled Events**: Redis Streams relay timer events to downstream consumers like logging, analytics, and alerting services.

## 🛡️ Design Philosophy

- **Secure-by-default**: Follows OWASP top 10 compliance; applies token expiration handling, CORS control, HTTPS enforcement, and secrets isolation.
- **Cloud-Native**: Deploys on **Azure Container Apps**, orchestrated via **Bicep templates** for full Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC).
- **Zero-downtime**: Blue-green deployments with GitHub Actions ensure smooth rollouts.
- **Production-Tuned**: Includes Sentry crash monitoring, Prometheus metrics, and Grafana dashboards for operational visibility.
- **Future-Proof**: Modular design supports plug-and-play architecture for additional event consumers, analytics engines, or notification services.

---

## 📊 Observability Overview

- **Redis Streams** capture time events (start, pause, resume).
- **FastAPI logger** pushes structured logs to LogDNA.
- **Prometheus** scrapes system and app-level metrics.
- **Grafana** visualizes timer event throughput, queue latencies, and system health.
- **Sentry** catches runtime and API exceptions.

---

## 🔒 Security Posture

- JWT expiration and refresh workflows handled securely.
- Social login integrations via OAuth2 providers.
- Separation of secrets using `python-decouple`, keeping codebase clean.
- Input sanitization and DRF serializers guard against payload tampering.

---

## 🔐 Encryption & Hashing

Chrona leverages **cryptographically sound defaults** and modern hashing techniques for securing sensitive data:

- **JWT Signing**: Tokens are signed using `HS256`, leveraging a securely stored signing key (`SECRET_KEY`) loaded via environment variables.
- **Password Hashing**: Django’s `PBKDF2` algorithm (with SHA-256) ensures all user passwords are salted and hashed before storage.
- **Sensitive Token Storage**: OAuth2 tokens and refresh secrets are never stored in plain text.
- **Field-level Hashing**: Optional hashing (e.g., SHA-256) is available for identifiers or anonymized fields when needed, especially for analytics or telemetry pipelines.
- **HTTPS Assumption**: All deployments are behind HTTPS by default, ensuring encrypted transit of all payloads.

## 🧩 Extensibility Roadmap
-    Robust Unit and integration test
- ⏰ WebSocket-based real-time updates for collaborative timers
- 📈 Event pipeline to a centralized analytics database (e.g., ClickHouse or TimescaleDB)
- 🧠 AI-generated timer suggestions via integration with OpenAI
- 📬 Email and push notifications based on timer state events
- 🔌 GraphQL API layer for granular queries and frontend flexibility
