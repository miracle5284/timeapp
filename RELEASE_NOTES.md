## ðŸŽ‰ Whatâ€™s New

### Backend Architecture and APIs

* Migrated to **modular service-oriented architecture**, designed for microservices readiness.
* Introduced **Countdown v2 API (countdown app)**:

* Added **Extension Info API** to dynamically provide extension config.

### Logging Microservice (FastAPI)

* Deployed dedicated logging microservice using Redis Streams.
* Supports scalable, decoupled log processing.

### Observability Stack

* Integrated **Prometheus + Grafana** for metrics visualization.
* Configured **PushGateway** for ephemeral job metrics.
* Centralized logging via **LogDNA**.

### Security and Authentication

* AES-128 encryption and HMAC SHA-256 hashing for secure, deterministic data handling.
* Password hashing upgraded to **Argon2** with stricter validation policies.
* Deprecated `django-allauth` in favor of lighter **social-auth-app-django**.
* ðŸ†• **OAuth flow stabilized** with isolated session handling for secure popup-based Google login.

### CI/CD and Infrastructure

* Introduced **Terraform** IaC for provisioning:

  * Azure Redis
  * Azure Container Apps
  * Vault (secrets)
* ðŸ†• Enhanced **CI/CD GitHub Actions** workflows to dynamically detect environments from branches/tags.
* ðŸ†• Added support for **minimum replica scaling** in Terraform deployments.

### Developer Experience

* Migrated to **Poetry** for Python dependency management.
* Implemented camelCase â†” snake\_case API transformations.
* Improved reverse proxy handling and CORS for cross-origin integrations.
* ðŸ†• Added reusable PR and release templates to standardize contributions.
